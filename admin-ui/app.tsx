              A nebula is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and
              other ionized gases. Originally, the term was used to describe any
              diffused astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky
              Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as
              the Andromeda Nebula (and spiral galaxies in general as "spiral
              nebulae") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the
              early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

              Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in
              diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth
              would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by. The Orion
              Nebula, the brightest nebula in the sky and occupying an area
              twice the angular diameter of the full Moon, can be viewed with
              the naked eye but was missed by early astronomers. Although denser
              than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense
              than any vacuum created on Earth â€“ a nebular cloud the size of the
              Earth would have a total mass of only a few kilograms.
